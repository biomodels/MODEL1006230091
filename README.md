# Model Notes


This a model from the article:  
**A mathematical model of the methionine cycle.**   
Reed MC, Nijhout HF, Sparks R, Ulrich CM. _J Theor Biol_ 2004 Jan

**Abstract:**   
Building on the work of Martinov et al. (2000), a mathematical model is
developed for the methionine cycle. A large amount of information is available
about the enzymes that catalyse individual reaction steps in the cycle, from
methionine to S-adenosylmethionine to S-adenosylhomocysteine to homocysteine,
and the removal of mass from the cycle by the conversion of homocysteine to
cystathionine. Nevertheless, the behavior of the cycle is very complicated
since many substrates alter the activities of the enzymes in the reactions
that produce them, and some can also alter the activities of other enzymes in
the cycle. The model consists of four differential equations, based on known
reaction kinetics, that can be solved to give the time course of the
concentrations of the four main substrates in the cycle under various
circumstances. We show that the behavior of the model in response to genetic
abnormalities and dietary deficiencies is similar to the changes seen in a
wide variety of experimental studies. We conduct computational "experiments"
that give understanding of the regulatory behavior of the methionine cycle
under normal conditions and the behavior in the presence of genetic variation
and dietary deficiencies.
